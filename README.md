Snowpocalypse
=============

A data visualization Im working on using twitter data from a recent snow storm in Portland, OR. This is an exercise Im working on primarily to learn interactive data visualization tools, in particular D3.js.

I was interested in how my fellow Portlandians were reacting to a snowstorm we had in early February so I wrote some PHP to harvest tweets during the storm and store them in a MySQL DB.  That code is not part of this repository (basically just twitter OAuth and some basic SQL queries). For now Ill be uploading json files for the various studies Im running on the data

Right now the visualization is just a static (and, unlabeled) bar graph of tweet frequency per hour starting the Monday before the storm and ending around 5pm PST Sunday as things were starting to melt.
